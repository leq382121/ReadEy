3 years later and I'm actually doing great. I have my own
place, a decent job, my pets are doing very well My credit
is shit from the divorce but really, I'm in decent company in
that This isn't really a sob story; I'm really proud ofwhat I've
done on my own. I Just wanted to share for possibly some
closure since I never really got that. Strangers on the
internet are better than keeping it inside for so long. And if
you hate my story Ijust lose some take points anyway. I
save these text messages to remind myself how far I've
come, not to cry over. Iâ€˜m still terrible in relationships but. .
